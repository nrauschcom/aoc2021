## Don't try this at home
In this year's Advent of Code, I'm trying to write very short (but ugly) javascript code, directly executable from the
Puzzle Inputs JavaScript Console.

Instead of writing real JavaScript code and minifying at the end, I'm really writing the code as-is, because I really
love the options you have when using JS and I want to have some fun.

There is no valid reason to write such code _at any time in your life_.

Don't do it.
